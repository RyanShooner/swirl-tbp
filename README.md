# swirl-tbp: template-based practice problems in swirl

This package allows for the addition of 'template-based' practice problems in swirl (http://swirlstats.com).

A 'template-based' problem is a problem where variable names, values, and other aspects are randomly generated at run-time, in order to provide students with an endless supply of problems for learning and assessment of R programming and data analysis concepts.

This work has been completed with the help of the following students during independent study courses at Eastern Connecticut State University:
 - Kyle Marotte
 - Ryan Shooner

Note from Kyle on 12/6/2015:  This repo is now as finished as it is going to be.  It's going out of my hands and into the hands of Dr. Dancik, and his new independent study students next semester.  Good luck, guys!
